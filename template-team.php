            <h1>Jesse McGinnis</h1>
            <h2>Presidential Candidate</h2>
            <p>The name is Jesse McGinnis, and I'm in 4-something Computer Science. I adore cats, owning one named Tinkus. I usually avoid watching TV, but every once in a while I'll come across a show that has to be binge watched (<i>*cough*</i> House of Cards <i>*cough*</i>). Coming from a smaller town, I place a high value on sticking to my words and maintaining the friendships I'm fortunate to develop. Most evenings I can be found with friends at a Starbucks enjoying the atmosphere and getting work done.</p>
            <p>I've been heavily involved with student space projects for well over a year now, and have dipped my hands into many areas; from Orientation, to the Board of Governors of the University, and currently the Board of Directors of Feds. I'm running to be your Feds President because I know I can bring passion and excitement to a position where your student needs are the utmost priority. I'm friendly (even when I haven't had my morning coffee) so if you see me around, stop me and say hi—I am easily distinguished by my red toque!</p>

            <h1>Luke McIntosh</h1>
            <h2>VP Education Candidate</h2>
            <p>Hi my name is Luke McIntosh and I am running for the position of Vice-president Education. I was born and raised in a small town called Listowel. When people ask me where that is I tell them you get lost and take a left. Growing up I worked on my family farm. This experience has helped me foster a strong work ethic and a willingness to dive head first into new projects.</p>
            <p>I am a huge Star Wars nerd and have more pieces of Darth Vader memorabilia then any one person should have. I also enjoy playing Magic the Gathering, old video games, and even Pokemon if I am feeling nostalgic. Like the rest of my team I love this university and have become very involved in order to give back. I am the current Chairperson of the Federation of Students Board of Directors, I am an Arts Councilor, and I am a Residence Life Don. If you see me on campus please stop me to have a chat. I love meeting new people because everyone has a unique story and can share new and exciting experiences.</p>

            <h2>
              VP Internal Candidate
            </h2>
            <p>My name is Anjali Gopal, and I'm in 4B Nanotechnology Engineering. Before deciding to go into engineering, I considered a varitey career choices such as a webdesigner, a teacher (doesn't everybody?), a doctor, and a <i>writer</i>, but eventually, my love for science and math drew me to engineering. I have yet to regret my choice!</p>
            <p>You'll quickly find that I'm extremely geeky, and have some really peculiar talents. For instance, I know how to say “in the name of the Moon, I shall punish you” in Japanese (a skill that I developed while watching the entire live action version of Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon). I also love to read (mostly fantasy novels; Game of Thrones FTW), and I adore sci-fi movies and TV shows.</p>
            <p>When I'm not geeking out with my latest fangirly obsession, I like to get involved in campus life. I've been heavily involved with orientation, and in a variety of Mental Health & Wellness initiatives. I'm extremely passionate about improving student life at Waterloo. I'm very outgoing and love to help people, so feel free to come up and say “Hi!”</p>

            <h1>Elizabeth McFaul</h1>
            <h2>VP Ops &amp; Finance Candidate</h2>
            <p>My name is Elizabeth McFaul, and I'm a fifth year student in marketing and statistics.</p>
            <p>I spend a lot of my time working with various theatre groups as a stage manager. I've been involved with theatre for over 10 years now, and have loved every moment of it! There's something magical about watching a show from auditions to opening night, and seeing it evolve. I usually tend to stay backstage, directing all the lights and the furniture, and tripping over things in the dark—but I've become the person who can handle anything that goes wrong, because the show must go on (even if you're missing actors)! </p>
            <p>I'm also obsessed with marketing and advertising. I'm the person who actually watches the commercials&mdash;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGzH7j5Pqzw" target="_blank">the M&M ones</a> are some of my favourites. A big part of my priorities for next year will be reinventing how Feds communicates with students: AMAs, polls, social media, and more. If you see me around campus over the next few weeks, share your favourite ad or way a product got you interested!</p>
